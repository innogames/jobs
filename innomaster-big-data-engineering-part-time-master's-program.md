And all this with a fixed monthly salary and complete coverage of tuition fees? Then, our InnoMaster Program is just right for you!

As part of the InnoMaster Big Data Engineering Program, you'll typically study alongside your job at a university offering an accredited part-time Master's program in IT/Data Engineering located in Hamburg or its surroundings (e.g. FH Wedel), and we'll cover the costs for you! Concurrently, you'll gain valuable practical work experience working within various Big Data environments such as Google Cloud and on-site Hadoop, allowing you to apply your theoretical knowledge directly into practice! Support our Data Engineers and Data Scientists in processing, managing, and analyzing our data. In addition to responsible tasks and appropriate compensation, we offer participation in training sessions (related to the field, programming languages, or soft skills) and support in further career development.

The InnoMaster Big Data Engineering program is designed for approximately three years, with a weekly workload of 25-40 hours depending on your university schedule. We are happy to assist if you have further questions regarding the program.
